# Beat the Fleet 🏁

> *The AI thinks it knows the fastest way. Prove it wrong. Get paid.*

A product concept and interactive mockup for gamifying autonomous vehicle rides — built with the comma four in mind.

## The Problem Nobody's Talking About

Autonomous fleets are trained on aggregate data. They're good at average. But cities aren't average — they're hyperlocal, they shift by hour, and the people who ride them every day know things no dataset has captured yet.

That alley behind the farmer's market that clears by 9:15. The light on MLK Jr Way that runs 40 seconds longer on Tuesdays. The cut-through that shaves four minutes off a ride nobody's ever logged.

That knowledge is sitting in people's heads, completely inaccessible to the model.

**Beat the Fleet puts it to work.**

## How It Works

Before your ride begins, you see two routes side by side:

- **The Fleet's pick** — the AI's optimal route, time estimate, traffic, stops
- **Your pick** — a route you think is faster, based on what you know

You choose. The ride runs. The clock doesn't lie.

Beat the fleet by a minute or more and earn credit off your comma prime subscription. The bigger the gap, the bigger the cut.

| Beat the fleet by | Reward |
|---|---|
| Under 1 min | No reward — close though |
| 1 – 2 min | **10% off** next prime month |
| 3 – 4 min | **15% off** next prime month |
| 5+ min | **50% off** next prime month |

## Why This Is Actually Smart

**For riders** — you're not a passenger anymore. You have skin in the game. A four-minute ride becomes something you've been thinking about since yesterday.

**For the fleet** — every ride is a labeled training sample with a real outcome attached. Shortcuts that win get absorbed into the model. Routes that lose confirm the AI was right. Either way, the model gets smarter. The cost of a 15% prime credit is nothing compared to a human-verified shortcut that improves routing for every future rider on that corridor.

**For growth** — people will ride more. They'll recruit their friends. They'll stake their local knowledge against a machine and tell everyone about it when they win. That's word-of-mouth you can't buy.

## The Mockup

`beat-the-fleet.html` — open it in any browser, no dependencies, no build step, no nonsense.

Built for a mobile/in-car screen. Includes:

- Live map with AI route and your route overlaid simultaneously
- Route cards with time, distance, traffic, and stop counts
- Reward tier table front and center *before* you commit — so you know what you're playing for
- Result screen with animated reward card, one-time promo code, and a nudge to the next tier up
- Local leaderboard — who's beating the fleet in your area this week
- Fleet-wide stats ticker — routes learned, global wins, today's top shortcut

## Status

Concept and working prototype. Not affiliated with comma.ai — just someone who thinks this should exist.
