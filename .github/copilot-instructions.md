# Copilot Instructions — Rider Engagement Ops Portfolio

## Goal
Reframe this repository as a Rider Engagement Operations / Growth Ops portfolio piece for an autonomous ride platform context. The demo must remain a **static GitHub Pages site** with no build step, no package manager, and no external dependencies beyond Google Fonts.

## Non-goals
- Do not integrate any real telemetry, routing APIs, or fleet data.
- Do not imply integration with specific vendors or brands (no comma.ai, no openpilot branding in copy).
- Do not add frameworks (React, Vue, etc.), bundlers, or package managers.
- Do not alter CSS, JavaScript logic, or visual/interaction structure — **copy and text only**.
- Do not introduce unsafe gamification language that could incentivize speeding or unsafe driving.

## Deliverables
- `index.html` — existing UI with updated neutral, ops-focused copy.
- `README.md` — portfolio-framed write-up for a mobility PM / Ops lead audience.
- `docs/ONE_PAGER.md` — concise ops one-pager with problem, hypothesis, journey, plan, safety, metrics, risks, and next steps.
- `docs/METRICS.md` — KPI definitions, guardrail metrics, event taxonomy, and A/B test design.
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — this file.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — static GitHub Pages deployment workflow.

## Style
- Use crisp, non-hype operations language appropriate for a senior mobility PM or Ops lead audience.
- Prefer measurable framing: include concrete metrics, success criteria, and phased rollout stages.
- Safety-gate language must appear in all docs: no reward eligibility for unsafe maneuvers.
- Avoid brand claims, superlatives, and marketing copy.
- Write as if presenting to an internal cross-functional review or to a prospective employer evaluating ops judgment.
