# Beat the Fleet — Copilot Operating Instructions

This repository is a static GitHub Pages portfolio project.

The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate Rider Engagement Operations thinking for autonomous ride platforms.

This is NOT:
- A production app
- A refactoring playground
- A styling exercise
- A performance optimization project

Your job is to modify ONLY what is explicitly requested.

## PROJECT POSITIONING

This repo must present as:

- A Rider Engagement Operations concept

## SAFETY & MATURITY CHECK

Before finalizing changes, confirm:

- Tone is professional.
- Language reflects operations maturity.
- No hype language.
- No antagonistic framing.
- Safety gating is mentioned where relevant.
- Rewards are described as small credits, not performance bounties.

If instructions are ambiguous:
- Ask clarifying questions.
- Do not assume.
